# Comeon Group Frontend Developer -Remote/Turkey Interview Assignment

Project bases on React (React usage is encouraged for that case), Redux and JSON-Server (for backend). 

## In order to run server, you can also use 'npm run server:start' as a shortcut.

## Explanation about project

During the working on assignment, i couldn't be sure whether i could make some changes on mock server to provide secure authentication or not,Therefore  i keep it as it is.
Then i decided to use simple cookie to provide "continue from where you left off". Cookie will be expired 5 minutes after the login as well as after logout.
To provide better UX, i thought that using CSSTransition for routes can be good, then i added :) 

Thank you very much for the assignment, it was an enjoy.
